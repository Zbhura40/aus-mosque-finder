Read the project-notes.md file and update the project-notes-for-zbthedummy.md file with a simplified, beginner-friendly version.

Translate all technical terms to everyday language:
- "Deploy" = "Upload to the internet"
- "Edge Functions" = "Code that runs online 24/7"
- "CORS" = "Security guard for websites"
- "API" = "Connection to Google's services"
- "CLI" = "Tool to control things from computer"

Keep the same overall structure but explain everything like you're talking to someone who has never coded before. Use analogies (LEGO pieces, gym memberships, house keys, etc.) to make concepts relatable.

Focus on:
1. What happened (in simple terms)
2. Why it matters (for the business/users)
3. What the user can do now (practical outcomes)

Remove technical code snippets and replace with simple descriptions of what the code does.
