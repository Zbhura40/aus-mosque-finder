# Quick Guide for Zubair 👋

## Your Two Project Note Files

### 📘 project-notes.md
**The Technical Version**
- Full technical details
- Code snippets and commands
- For developers and Claude to reference
- Gets updated during work sessions

### 📗 project-notes-for-zbthedummy.md
**Your Simple Version**
- Everything explained in plain English
- No confusing tech jargon
- Perfect for understanding what was done
- Gets updated when the technical version updates

---

## How to Keep Them in Sync

### Automatic Way (Recommended)
Every time I update `project-notes.md`, just remind me with:
> "Update the simple notes too"

I'll automatically translate the technical stuff to simple language.

### Manual Way (If I Forget)
Type this command in Claude Code:
```
/sync-notes
```

## What Each File Tells You

## When to Read Which File

**Read the Simple Version When:**
- You want to understand what we did
- You're explaining progress to someone else
- You need to check costs or security
- You want to know what features are ready

**Read the Technical Version When:**
- You're working with another developer
- You need exact commands to repeat something
- You're troubleshooting an issue
- Claude asks "what did we do last time?"

## Quick Example

**Technical Version Says:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy autocomplete-suburb
```

**Simple Version Says:**
> "Uploaded the suburb search tool to the internet so it works 24/7 for everyone"

---

## Your Workflow

1. **During Session:** I update `project-notes.md` with technical details
2. **End of Session:** I automatically create simple version in `project-notes-for-zbthedummy.md`
3. **You Read:** The simple version to understand what happened
4. **You Share:** With team/partners using the simple version

---

## Tips

💡 **Bookmark the simple notes** - It's your go-to file for understanding progress
💡 **Keep both files** - Technical notes help me remember what we did
💡 **Share the simple version** - When explaining to non-technical people
💡 **Never delete either** - They work together as a team
