## 🎯 OUTER RING: What's Possible (All 19 Channels)

Following Bullseye's first step: brainstorm ONE decent strategy for each of the 19 traction channels. Don't dismiss any - the goal is to counteract biases.

## 🎯 INNER RING: What's Working (Focus Phase)

**You won't know your Inner Ring channel until after 4-5 weeks of testing.**

However, based on similar directory businesses, here are the likely winners:

### Most Likely Core Channel: **SEO + Business Development Hybrid**

**Why:**
- Directory sites thrive on organic search (people actively looking for mosques)
- Mosque partnerships create backlinks (helps SEO) + direct referral traffic
- Low ongoing cost once built
- Scales as you add more mosques and city pages

**If this becomes your core channel, your Inner Ring focus will be:**
1. Create 100+ city landing pages (Phase 3 SEO)
2. Get links from all 342 mosques (Week 2 emails expanded)
3. Optimize on-page SEO for every mosque page
4. Build more free tools (prayer times, qibla) to attract links
5. Write content (blog) targeting long-tail keywords

### Second Most Likely: **Community Building + Word of Mouth**

**Why:**
- Australian Muslim community is tight-knit
- WhatsApp groups, Facebook groups are highly active
- One mosque recommending you = 500-1000 users
- Viral loop: user finds mosque → tells friends → they use site

**If this becomes your core channel, your Inner Ring focus will be:**
1. Build referral program (incentivize sharing)
2. Create WhatsApp/Facebook community groups
3. Attend every Islamic event in Sydney/Melbourne
4. Get mosque Imams to mention site in Friday sermons
5. Build features that encourage sharing (sharable mosque cards)

### Third Possibility: **Paid Ads (SEM/Facebook)**

**Why:**
- If cost per user stays under $0.75 and lifetime value is positive
- Can scale quickly with budget
- Predictable growth

**If this becomes your core channel, your Inner Ring focus will be:**
1. Optimize ad copy continuously (A/B testing)
2. Expand to more keywords/audiences
3. Improve conversion rate on landing pages
4. Set up retargeting campaigns
5. Increase budget gradually ($10/day → $50/day → $200/day)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM TRACTION BOOK

2. **Your first ideas will be biased** - That's why Outer Ring brainstorming is crucial

3. **Test cheaply and quickly** - $1,000 and 1 month max per channel test

4. **One channel will dominate** - Don't spread yourself thin

5. **Channel strategies saturate over time** - Always be testing new tactics

6. **Unscalable tactics are OK for early growth** - Mint asked bloggers manually, you can too

7. **Quantitative tracking is non-negotiable** - Use the spreadsheet religiously

8. **Speed matters** - Companies that move fast with testing win

Subject: Feature [Mosque Name] on Find My Mosque 🕌

Salaam [Name],

I'm reaching out from Find My Mosque (findmymosque.org), a new directory
helping Australian Muslims find mosques across the country.

We've verified and listed 342 mosques, including [Mosque Name], and I wanted
to offer you a free premium feature on our homepage. We're trying to make it
easier for the community to discover mosques, especially for:
- New Muslims looking for welcoming spaces
- Travelers searching for prayer locations
- Muslims relocating to new suburbs

Would [Mosque Name] be interested in:
✅ Featured listing on our homepage
✅ Link to your website from our directory
✅ Sharing this resource with your congregation?

In return, if you could add a link to Find My Mosque on your website or
mention us in your Friday announcements, that would help us reach more of
the community.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Australian Startup Maps 342 Mosques to Help Muslims Find Prayer Spaces

[Your City, Date] - Find My Mosque, a new Australian directory, has launched
to help Muslims across the country locate nearby mosques and Islamic centers.
The platform features 342 verified mosques spanning all states and territories.

"We built this after realizing how difficult it was for Muslims, especially
new converts and travelers, to find mosques in unfamiliar areas," says
[Your Name], founder of Find My Mosque. "Google Maps doesn't always have
accurate mosque data, so we spent months verifying locations, prayer times,
and contact information."

The directory includes:
- Search by location or radius
- Detailed mosque information
- Links to official websites
- State-by-state browsing

The platform is completely free for both users and mosques. Find My Mosque
is currently reaching out to mosques across Australia to ensure accurate
listings and gather community feedback.
