## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **One channel will dominate** - Don't spread thin
2. **Test cheap and fast** - Max $1,000 and 1 month per test
3. **Track everything quantitatively** - Use spreadsheet religiously
4. **Most startups get ZERO channels to work** - Finding one = success
5. **Your first ideas are biased** - That's why you test systematically

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Testing too many channels at once (max 2-3 at a time)
❌ Not tracking numbers in spreadsheet
❌ Giving up on a test too early (need 7-14 days minimum)
❌ Continuing to test after finding your core channel (focus instead!)
❌ Spending too much on tests (keep it cheap!)

---

## 📞 DECISION FRAMEWORK (Week 5)

**After 4 weeks, ask:**

1. Which channel had lowest cost per user?
2. Which had highest quality users (time on site, engagement)?
3. Which is most scalable (can you 10x it)?
4. Which fits your strengths (skills, resources)?

**Pick ONE. That's your Inner Ring.**

Then: Go ALL IN on that channel. Scale it 5x-10x.
