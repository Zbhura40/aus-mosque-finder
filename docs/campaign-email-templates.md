## Template 1: Featured Mosque Partnership (Recommended)

**Subject Line:** Free Featured Page for [Mosque Name] on findmymosque.org

**Email Body:**

```
Assalamu Alaikum,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of findmymosque.org - a free, ad-free mosque directory helping Australian Muslims find their nearest mosque.

We've recently launched and are inviting select mosques to partner with us for a free featured listing. I'd love to offer [Mosque Name] this opportunity.

**What you'll get (100% free):**

‚úÖ Custom featured mosque page with:
   - Your prayer times, contact details, and directions
   - Google reviews integration
   - Photo gallery
   - Events calendar
   - Community programs showcase

‚úÖ Verified "Partner Mosque" badge for your website

‚úÖ Priority placement in search results

**Here's an example:** https://findmymosque.org/mosques/holland-park-mosque
(We built this for Holland Park Mosque to show what's possible)

**All we ask in return:**
A simple link from your website to findmymosque.org - this helps more Muslims discover mosques across Australia.

**Would you be interested?**
I'd be happy to build your custom page and send you a preview before we go live.

No cost, no obligations - just a small way to support the Australian Muslim community.

JazakAllah Khair,
[Your Name]
Founder, findmymosque.org

## Pro Tips for Higher Response Rates

1. **Send from a personal email** (not noreply@...)
2. **Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-2pm** (best open rates)
3. **Keep it under 150 words** (mosque admins are busy)
4. **Include your phone number** (builds trust)
5. **Use "Reply" (not BCC)** - personal 1-to-1 emails perform better
6. **Reference something specific** about their mosque if possible
7. **Follow up!** Most responses come from follow-up #1

---
