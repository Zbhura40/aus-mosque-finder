# Cold Email Campaign Launch Checklist

> **Campaign:** Mosque Partnership Outreach
> **Goal:** Get 3-5 mosques to partner (featured page + backlink)
> **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks from first email to final follow-up

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch Setup (Complete Before Sending)

### ✅ 1. Email Account Setup

- [ ] Verify your personal email is working (Gmail recommended)
- [ ] Add professional email signature:
  ```
  [Your Name]
  Founder, findmymosque.org
  [Your Phone Number]
  findmymosque.org
  ```
- [ ] Test email deliverability (send test email to yourself)
- [ ] Make sure you can receive replies

### ✅ 2. Review Campaign Files

- [ ] Read [campaign-email-templates.md](campaign-email-templates.md)
- [ ] Review [campaign-test-batch.csv](campaign-test-batch.csv) (your first 5 mosques)
- [ ] Review [campaign-emails-ready.csv](campaign-emails-ready.csv) (all 20 mosques)
- [ ] Open [campaign-tracker-template.csv](campaign-tracker-template.csv) in Google Sheets

### ✅ 3. Choose Your Template

**Pick ONE template to start with:**
- [ ] **Template 1:** Featured Mosque Partnership (Recommended - shows value first)
- [ ] **Template 2:** Verified Profile (Softer approach - asks question first)
- [ ] **Template 3:** Direct & Concise (For busy admins)

**I recommend Template 1** because it leads with the biggest value (free featured page + Holland Park example).

### ✅ 4. Personalize Template

**For each mosque in test batch, customize:**
- [ ] Replace `[Mosque Name]` with actual name
- [ ] Add your name to `[Your Name]`
- [ ] Add your phone to `[Your Phone]`
- [ ] (Optional) Add a personal touch: "I noticed you have [unique program]..."

### ✅ 5. Set Up Tracking

**Option A: Simple Spreadsheet (Recommended)**
- [ ] Open `campaign-tracker-template.csv` in Google Sheets
- [ ] Bookmark the sheet for quick access
- [ ] You'll manually update this after sending/receiving emails

**Option B: Gmail + Google Sheets**
- [ ] Install "Yet Another Mail Merge" Chrome extension
- [ ] Connect it to your Google Sheets tracker
- [ ] It will auto-track opens (optional, but nice to have)

---

### 📧 Day 7: Send Follow-Up #1 (to non-responders only)

**Who to follow up with:**
- [ ] Mosques that didn't respond (probably 3-4 of the 5)
- [ ] Skip mosques that already replied (even if they said no)

**Use Follow-Up Template #1 from [campaign-email-templates.md](campaign-email-templates.md)**

**Sending process:**

---

### 📊 Day 11-12: Check Follow-Up Responses

**Most responses will come now!** (Follow-ups often perform better than initial email)

- [ ] Check inbox for replies
- [ ] Update tracker for any new responses
- [ ] Reply immediately to positive responses
- [ ] For still-no-response mosques, prepare for final follow-up

---

### 📧 Day 14: Send Follow-Up #2 (Final attempt)

**Last chance email:**
- [ ] Use Follow-Up Template #2 (from templates doc)
- [ ] Keep it short and polite
- [ ] Give them an easy out ("This is my last email...")
- [ ] Update tracker: "Follow-Up 2 Date"

**After sending:**
- [ ] Wait 5 days
- [ ] After Day 19, mark non-responders as "No Response" in tracker
- [ ] Consider calling them (you have phone numbers!)

---

## Phase 3: Analyze & Adjust (Before Full Launch)

### 📊 Test Batch Results Analysis

**After 14-19 days, calculate your metrics:**

- [ ] **Open rate:** How many mosques likely saw it? (Estimate: 20-30%)
- [ ] **Response rate:** How many replied? (Target: 1-2 mosques)
- [ ] **Positive responses:** How many said yes? (Target: 1 mosque minimum)
- [ ] **Questions raised:** What concerns did they have?

**Review your template:**
- [ ] Did mosques ask similar questions? (Add those answers to next emails)
- [ ] Any confusion about what you're offering? (Clarify in template)
- [ ] Subject line too salesy? (Try Template 2 for next batch)

**Decide: Continue or Adjust?**

**If you got 1+ positive response:**
- ✅ Your template works! Continue with remaining 15 mosques

**If you got 0 positive responses:**
- 🔄 Try Template 2 for next 5 emails
- 📞 Consider calling mosques instead
- 💡 Review Holland Park demo page - is it impressive enough?

---

## Phase 4: Full Campaign Launch (Remaining 15 Mosques)

### 📧 Batch 2: Next 5 Mosques (Day 20-21)

**Select next 5 mosques from [campaign-emails-ready.csv](campaign-emails-ready.csv)**

Recommended prioritization:
1. Mosques with phone numbers (easier to follow up)
2. Mosques in NSW/VIC (larger communities)
3. Mosques with active websites (more likely to add backlink)

- [ ] Personalize emails for each mosque
- [ ] Send on Tuesday-Thursday morning
- [ ] Update tracker
- [ ] Set follow-up reminders (Day 27, Day 34)

---

### 📧 Batch 3: Next 5 Mosques (Day 25-26)

## Phase 5: Follow-Up & Close (Week 6-8)

### 📞 Phone Follow-Up (Optional but Effective!)

**For mosques that didn't respond to emails:**
- [ ] Call during business hours (10am-3pm, Tuesday-Thursday)
- [ ] Use this script:

```
"Assalamu Alaikum, my name is [Your Name]. I sent a few emails about
featuring [Mosque Name] on findmymosque.org - did you get a chance to
see those? No pressure at all, I just wanted to make sure they didn't
go to spam. Would you have 2 minutes for me to explain?"
```

- [ ] Be friendly and respectful
- [ ] Don't push if they're not interested
- [ ] Update tracker with call outcome

---

### 🎯 Build Featured Pages (For YES responses)

## What to Do If Response Rate is Low

**If after 20 emails you get 0-1 responses:**

**Option 1: Phone Outreach**
- Call the 232 mosques with phone numbers
- Much higher response rate (20-40%)
- Builds relationships

**Option 2: Improve Value Proposition**
- Make Holland Park demo even better
- Add more features to featured pages
- Offer free prayer times widget

**Option 3: Different Approach**
- Try backlink building via directories first
- Build credibility, then approach mosques
- Use social proof ("50 mosques already listed")

## Email Campaign Tools (All Free)

**Tracking & Automation:**
1. **Gmail + Google Sheets** (Manual but personal)
2. **Yet Another Mail Merge** (Free Chrome extension for Gmail)
3. **Mailchimp Free Tier** (Up to 500 contacts)
