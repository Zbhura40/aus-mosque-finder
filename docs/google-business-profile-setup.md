# Google Business Profile Setup Guide

> **Why this matters:** When people search "mosque near me," Google shows map results FIRST. You need to be listed there to get traffic within days.

## Step-by-Step Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Profile

1. **Go to:** https://www.google.com/business/
2. **Click** "Manage now" or "Get started"
3. **Sign in** with your Google account

### Step 2: Enter Business Information

**Business Name:**
```
Find My Mosque - Australian Mosque Directory
```

**Business Category:** Choose one of these (most relevant first):
- "Website" (primary choice)
- "Internet Company"
- "Religious Organization"

### Step 3: Add Location

**Important:** Since you're an online directory (not a physical location), choose:
- Select "No, I don't have a location customers can visit"
- Then choose "Yes, I serve customers at their locations"

**Service Area:** Select "Australia" or specific states (NSW, VIC, QLD, etc.)

### Step 4: Contact Details

**Website:** https://findmymosque.org

**Phone:** (Optional - only add if you want people to call you)

### Step 5: Finish & Verify

Google will send a **verification code** to verify you own the business. This usually comes via:
- Email (fastest - usually within 5 minutes)
- Phone call
- Postcard (if physical address provided)

**Choose email verification** if available - it's quickest!

### Step 6: Complete Your Profile

Once verified, add these details:

**Description:** (Use this exact text - it's optimized for search)
```
Find My Mosque is Australia's most comprehensive verified mosque directory. We help Muslims find nearby mosques, masjids, and prayer facilities across all states and territories. Search 340+ verified mosques with addresses, directions, and contact details. 100% free with no ads.
```

**Hours:** Set as "Open 24 hours" (since your website is always accessible)

**Photos:**
- Add a screenshot of your homepage
- Add the mosque-hero image from your site
- Google loves profiles with photos!
