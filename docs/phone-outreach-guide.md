## ðŸ“ž Phone Call Script (3 Versions)

### Version 1: Holland Park Mosque (Demo Already Built)

**Opening:**
```
Assalamu Alaikum, is this Holland Park Mosque?

[Yes]

Great! My name is [Your Name]. I'm calling from findmymosque.org -
we're a free, community-built mosque directory for Australian Muslims.

I wanted to let you know that we've actually already built a
featured page for Holland Park Mosque as an example for other
mosques. It's live at findmymosque.org/mosques/holland-park-mosque

Would you have 2-3 minutes for me to walk you through it?
```

**Middle (If they say yes):**
```
Perfect! So the page includes your prayer times, Google reviews,
photos, contact details, and information about your community programs
and partnerships.

We built it completely free as a way to help Muslims in Brisbane
find your mosque more easily. You can check it out anytime at
findmymosque.org/mosques/holland-park-mosque

Now, we'd love to make this official partnership. All we ask in
return is a simple link from your website back to findmymosque.org -
it helps other Muslims discover mosques across Australia.

Would Holland Park Mosque be interested in this partnership?
```

**Closing (If yes):**
```
Fantastic! Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you an email with the page link and a simple HTML
   snippet you can add to your website (takes 2 minutes)
2. Once the link is added, we'll mark you as an official
   Partner Mosque and send you a badge for your website
3. That's it! No fees, no ongoing commitment.

Can I get your email address to send those details?

[Get email, confirm spelling]

Perfect! I'll send that through today. JazakAllah Khair for
supporting the Muslim community!
```

### Version 2: Preston Mosque (No Email, Phone Only)

**Opening:**
```
Assalamu Alaikum, is this Omar Bin Al Khattab Masjid?

[Yes]

Great! My name is [Your Name]. I'm calling from findmymosque.org -
a free mosque directory helping Australian Muslims find local mosques.

I tried to reach you by email but couldn't find one listed.
Do you have 2-3 minutes? I'd love to tell you about a free
featured listing we're offering to select mosques.
```

**Middle (If they say yes):**
```
Perfect! So here's what we're offering:

We'll create a custom featured page for your mosque - kind of like
a mini-website - with your prayer times, contact details, photos,
events, and community programs.

Here's an example we built for Holland Park Mosque:
findmymosque.org/mosques/holland-park-mosque

Completely free, no ads, just a way to help Muslims in Melbourne
find your mosque.

All we ask in return is a simple link from your website to
findmymosque.org - helps other Muslims discover mosques across Australia.

Does this sound like something Omar Bin Al Khattab Masjid would
be interested in?
```

**Closing (If yes):**
```
Excellent! Let me get your email address so I can send you:
1. A preview of what your page would look like
2. The simple link code for your website

[Get email, confirm spelling]

Perfect! I'll build a draft page and email it to you within
3-5 days. You can review it and let me know if you'd like
any changes before we go live.

JazakAllah Khair! I'll be in touch soon.
```

---

### Version 3: Follow-Up Call (For emailed mosques)

**Opening:**
```
Assalamu Alaikum, is this [Mosque Name]?

[Yes]

Great! My name is [Your Name] from findmymosque.org.

I sent a few emails about creating a free featured page for
[Mosque Name], and I wanted to follow up to make sure they
didn't go to spam.

Did you happen to see those emails?
```

**If they DID see the email:**
```
Oh good! I'm just following up to see if you had any questions
or if this is something [Mosque Name] would be interested in?

[Answer questions, pitch benefits]

Would you like me to build a preview page so you can see what
it would look like before deciding?
```

**If they DIDN'T see the email:**
```
No worries! Let me quickly explain. We're offering select mosques
a free featured listing on findmymosque.org - Australia's
community-built mosque directory.

It's kind of like a mini-website for your mosque with prayer times,
photos, events, contact details - all free.

Here's an example: findmymosque.org/mosques/holland-park-mosque

All we ask is a simple link from your website to help other Muslims
find local mosques.

Would you have 2 minutes for me to tell you more, or should I
re-send the email with all the details?
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Handling Common Responses

### "We're too busy right now"
**Response:**
```
I completely understand! No pressure at all.

Would it help if I just built a preview page and emailed it to you?
You can review it when you have time, and there's no obligation
to use it.

What's the best email to send it to?
```

---

### "How much does this cost?"
**Response:**
```
Nothing at all! It's 100% free. No fees, no ads, no hidden costs.

We're building this as a community resource - just Muslims helping
Muslims find local mosques. We don't charge mosques anything.

The only thing we ask for is a simple link from your website,
which takes about 2 minutes to add.
```

---

### "We don't have a website"
**Response:**
```
No problem! Do you have a Facebook page or any online presence?

[If yes]: Perfect! You could link from your Facebook About section,
or even just share the page with your community. The featured
listing still helps Muslims find you when they search online.

[If no]: That's okay! The listing still helps people discover your
mosque. We just ask that you mention findmymosque.org to your
community - word of mouth is valuable too.
```

---

### "Can I see an example first?"
**Response:**
```
Absolutely! That's the best way to understand what we're offering.

The easiest thing is to check out the Holland Park Mosque page:
findmymosque.org/mosques/holland-park-mosque

Or if you give me your email, I can send you the link plus
build a preview page specifically for [Mosque Name] - takes me
about 3 days to create.

Which would you prefer?
```

---

### "We need to discuss with our committee"
**Response:**
```
That's completely reasonable! Here's what I can do:

I'll email you a proposal with:
1. The Holland Park example page
2. Benefits for your mosque
3. What we're asking for in return
4. Next steps if you're interested

You can share that with your committee and get back to me
whenever you're ready. No rush!

What's the best email address for me to send that to?
```

---

### "We already have a website, we don't need this"
**Response:**
```
That's great that you have a website! This isn't meant to
replace your website at all.

Think of it more like a listing in a directory - similar to
Google Maps or Yellow Pages. When Muslims search for "mosques
near me" or "mosques in [city]", your featured page helps them
discover you.

It actually drives more traffic TO your website - we link to
your site from the featured page.

Many mosques with strong websites still partner with us for
the extra visibility. Would that be valuable for [Mosque Name]?
```

---

### "What's the catch?"
**Response:**
```
I totally get the skepticism - it sounds too good to be true!

The "catch" is just that we ask for a simple link from your
website to findmymosque.org. That's it.

Why? Because when mosques link to us, it helps us rank higher
on Google, which means more Muslims can discover ALL mosques
across Australia - including yours.

It's a win-win: you get a free featured page, we get visibility
to help more Muslims find mosques.

No fees, no data collection, no ads. Just a community project
to help Australian Muslims.
```

---

### "Why are you doing this for free?"
**Response:**
```
Great question! A few reasons:

1. I'm Muslim, and I wanted to create something that benefits
   the community - sadaqah jariyah, insha'Allah

2. There's no good mosque directory for Australia - I built
   this to fix that problem

3. We're not a business - no ads, no fees, no data selling.
   Just a free resource for Muslims

The backlinks from mosque websites help us with SEO, which
means more Muslims can discover mosques. That's our "payment" -
helping us help the community.

Does that make sense?
```
