### Target 1: Mosques in Your Directory (Easiest)

**Strategy:** Contact the 340+ mosques and ask them to link to you

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Your mosque is listed on Find My Mosque Australia

We've included [Mosque Name] in our free Australian mosque directory at findmymosque.org.

The directory helps Muslims across Australia find nearby mosques for prayer. We've verified all information with Google Places and provide directions, contact details, and addresses.

If you'd like to help more people discover your mosque, would you consider:
1. Adding a link to findmymosque.org from your website
2. Sharing the directory with your community

You can view your listing here: [Link to search results]

JazakAllah khair,
