## üî¥ REDDIT SCRIPTS

### Script 1: r/australia (General Tech Community)

**Title:**
```
Built a free mosque directory for Aussie Muslims - feedback welcome
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/australia,

Over the past few months I've been building a directory to help Australian Muslims (and tourists) find local mosques - findmymosque.org

**Current state:**
‚Ä¢ 340+ verified mosques across all states
‚Ä¢ Search by location/radius
‚Ä¢ Browse by state pages
‚Ä¢ Mobile-friendly
‚Ä¢ Free, no ads

**Why I'm posting:**
Not asking for promotion - genuinely keen for feedback on usability and design. I'm not a professional designer so the UX is probably rough in places.

Specific questions:
1. Is the search interface intuitive?
2. What would make the site more useful?
3. Any bugs or obvious issues?

**Tech details:**
Built with React/TypeScript, Supabase backend, Google Places API for data. Happy to discuss the technical side if anyone's interested.

Link: findmymosque.org

All feedback appreciated - positive or negative!

Cheers
```

**Why this version works:**
- More humble ("feedback welcome" vs "would love")
- Shorter sentences (easier to read)
- Uses Aussie vernacular ("keen", "Cheers")
- "Not asking for promotion" - disarms skeptics
- Specific technical details (builds credibility)

Built a mosque finder for Sydney - looking for feedback from local Muslims
```

Assalamu Alaikum Sydney Muslims,

‚Ä¢ 125+ mosques across Greater Sydney
‚Ä¢ Search by suburb/postcode
‚Ä¢ Distance filtering
‚Ä¢ Links to mosque websites where available

**What I need from you:**
1. Missing mosques? Let me know and I'll add them
2. Incorrect info? Please flag it
3. Feature suggestions? What would help most?

Direct link: findmymosque.org/sydney-mosques

Still very much a work in progress based on community input.

JazakAllah Khair

### Template 3: "How do I find a mosque as a new Muslim?"

**Question:** "How do I find a mosque as a new Muslim?"

**Answer:**
```
Congratulations on your journey! Finding your first mosque can feel intimidating, but the Muslim community is generally very welcoming to new Muslims. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Locate nearby mosques**

**Tools to use:**
‚Ä¢ **Find My Mosque** (findmymosque.org) - Australian directory with 340+ mosques, search by location
‚Ä¢ **Zabihah.com** - Global mosque/halal restaurant finder
‚Ä¢ **Google Maps** - Search "mosque near [your area]"
‚Ä¢ **Islamic Council** - Your local Islamic council maintains lists

**Step 2: Research before visiting**

**Look for:**
‚úì New Muslim/Revert programs (many mosques have these!)
‚úì English-speaking community
‚úì Active social media (shows welcoming culture)
‚úì Women's facilities (if applicable)
‚úì Reviews mentioning "convert-friendly" or "welcoming"

**Mosques known for supporting new Muslims:**

*US examples:*
‚Ä¢ Islamic Center of Orange County (California)
‚Ä¢ East Plano Islamic Center (Texas)
‚Ä¢ Dar Al-Hijrah (Virginia)

*UK examples:*
‚Ä¢ East London Mosque
‚Ä¢ Birmingham Central Mosque

*Australia:*
‚Ä¢ Lakemba Mosque (Sydney)
‚Ä¢ Preston Mosque (Melbourne)

**Step 3: Make first contact**

**Before visiting - call or email ahead:**
"Assalamu Alaikum, I'm a new Muslim and would like to visit your mosque. Can you advise when is a good time? Do you have programs for new Muslims?"

Most mosques will be thrilled to hear from you and go out of their way to help!

**Step 4: First visit - what to expect**

**What to bring:**
‚Ä¢ Modest clothing (covered arms, legs for men and women)
‚Ä¢ Women: Headscarf (though some mosques provide loaners)
‚Ä¢ Socks (you'll remove shoes)

**What will happen:**
‚Ä¢ Someone will likely greet you warmly
‚Ä¢ They'll show you where to pray/sit
‚Ä¢ Invite you to community events
‚Ä¢ Offer to answer questions
‚Ä¢ Possibly introduce you to other new Muslims

**Step 5: Build community connections**

**Best ways to integrate:**
‚Ä¢ Attend Friday prayers (Jummah) - main weekly gathering
‚Ä¢ Join new Muslim classes (shahada/basics classes)
‚Ä¢ Ask for a mentor or "mosque buddy"
‚Ä¢ Attend social events (iftar dinners, Eid celebrations)
‚Ä¢ Connect with other reverts/converts

**Common Concerns - Addressed:**

**"I don't know how to pray properly"**
‚Üí Most mosques have people specifically dedicated to teaching new Muslims. They're patient and kind. Don't worry about making mistakes!

**"I don't speak Arabic"**
‚Üí Most Muslims globally don't speak Arabic as their first language. Many mosques have English-speaking communities, especially in Western countries.

**"What if I do something wrong?"**
‚Üí Everyone was new once. Muslims are generally very understanding and will gently guide you. It's okay to ask questions!

**"Will I be judged?"**
‚Üí New Muslims are highly respected in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said converts come "as white as snow" (free of sins). Most communities celebrate new Muslims!

**Specific Tips:**

**Best times to visit:**
‚Ä¢ After Jummah (Friday prayers) - easiest to meet people
‚Ä¢ During Ramadan - very welcoming atmosphere
‚Ä¢ Community events (Eid, fundraisers, lectures)

**Questions to ask:**
‚Ä¢ "Do you have new Muslim classes?"
‚Ä¢ "Can someone teach me how to pray?"
‚Ä¢ "Are there other new Muslims I can connect with?"

**Online Resources (supplement mosque):**
‚Ä¢ SeekersGuidance - Free Islamic courses
‚Ä¢ Bayyinah TV - English Islamic lectures
‚Ä¢ r/converts (Reddit community)
‚Ä¢ Local Islamic center classes

**My biggest advice:**

Don't be afraid to shop around! If one mosque doesn't feel welcoming, try another. Different mosques have different cultures, and it's important to find one where you feel comfortable.

May Allah make your journey easy and bless you abundantly. Welcome to the community! ü§≤

‚Ä¢ "New Muslim friendly" indicators
‚Ä¢ Women's facility details
‚Ä¢ Accessibility information

Use a combination:

2. **Find My Mosque or Google Maps** - Finding specific mosques

This covers most Muslim traveler needs!

**Location-Specific Recommendations:**

**Australia:** Find My Mosque

**Middle East:** Google Maps (comprehensive there)
**Southeast Asia:** Muslim Pro

Hope this helps! Let me know your location if you want specific recommendations.

**When someone asks "Can you add [mosque name]?"**
```
Absolutely! Thanks for the suggestion. I'll add [Mosque Name] today and reply here when it's live. Do you happen to have the address or website handy? Makes it easier to verify! üôè
```

**When someone reports a bug:**
```
Thanks for catching this! You're absolutely right - that's a bug. I'll fix it today and update you here. Really appreciate you testing it! üôè

```

**When someone suggests a feature:**
```
Great suggestion! [Feature name] is definitely on the roadmap. Quick question - would you prefer [Option A] or [Option B] for how it works?

Just want to make sure I build what people actually need!
```

**When someone criticizes:**
```
Really appreciate the honest feedback. You're right about [issue they mentioned]. This is definitely something I need to improve.

Any specific suggestions on how to fix it? Always keen to hear ideas!
```

**When someone asks "How do you make money?"**
```
Great question - I don't (yet)! Currently costs me ~$34/month to run (Google API + hosting), which I'm covering myself.

Long-term, I might explore:
- Mosque profile upgrades (premium listings)
- Respectful, halal advertising
- Community donations

But for now, 100% free community service. Open to ideas though!
```

**When someone loves it:**
```
JazakAllah Khair! / Thanks so much! That really means a lot.

If you know anyone who might find it useful, feel free to share! Always looking for feedback to make it better too. üòä
```

**When someone asks "Why not just use Google?"**
```
Fair question! Google Maps is great, but I found a few gaps:
1. Hard to filter JUST mosques (shows Islamic schools, closed mosques, community centers)
2. No state-by-state browsing
3. Missing prayer time info
4. Not optimized for Muslim-specific needs (women's facilities, new Muslim programs, etc.)

That said, we actually USE Google's data behind the scenes for accuracy! This is just a more specialized interface.
