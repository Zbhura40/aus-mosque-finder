### Week 4: Dynamic Sitemap & Automation ✅
**Completed:** October 7, 2025

**Implementation:**

#### 1. Sitemap Configuration System
**File:** `scripts/sitemap-config.js`

```javascript
export const BASE_URL = 'https://findmymosque.org';

export const routes = [
  // Main pages
  { path: '/', priority: 1.0, changefreq: 'daily' },
  { path: '/faq', priority: 0.8, changefreq: 'monthly' },
  { path: '/imam-profiles', priority: 0.8, changefreq: 'monthly' },
  { path: '/feedback', priority: 0.7, changefreq: 'monthly' },

  // City pages (high priority)
  { path: '/mosques-sydney', priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/mosques-melbourne', priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/mosques-brisbane', priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/mosques-perth', priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/mosques-adelaide', priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/mosques-tasmania', priority: 0.9, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/halal-supermarkets', priority: 0.8, changefreq: 'weekly' },

  // Individual mosque pages
  { path: '/?mosque=lakemba-mosque', priority: 0.6, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  { path: '/?mosque=auburn-gallipoli-mosque', priority: 0.6, changefreq: 'weekly' },
  // ... more mosques
];
```

**Total Routes:** 18 URLs

---

#### 2. Sitemap Generator Script
**File:** `scripts/generate-sitemap.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ Validates configuration (no duplicates, valid priorities)
- ✅ Groups URLs by type (main/city/mosque)
- ✅ Auto-updates lastmod dates
- ✅ Generates valid XML with proper namespaces
- ✅ Error handling with exit codes

**Validation Checks:**
```javascript
// Check for duplicate paths
const paths = routes.map(r => r.path);
const duplicates = paths.filter((path, index) =>
  paths.indexOf(path) !== index
);

// Validate priorities (0.0 - 1.0)
routes.forEach(route => {
  if (route.priority < 0 || route.priority > 1) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid priority for ${route.path}`);
  }
});

// Validate changefreq values
const validFreqs = ['always', 'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'yearly', 'never'];
routes.forEach(route => {
  if (!validFreqs.includes(route.changefreq)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid changefreq for ${route.path}`);
  }
});
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Manual generation
npm run generate-sitemap

# Automatic (runs on build)
npm run build
```

---

#### 3. Build Integration
**File:** `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "npm run generate-sitemap",
    "generate-sitemap": "node scripts/generate-sitemap.js",
    "build": "tsc && vite build"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

**Workflow:**
1. Developer runs `npm run build`
2. `prebuild` hook triggers automatically
3. `generate-sitemap.js` validates config
4. Sitemap written to `public/sitemap.xml`
5. Build proceeds with fresh sitemap included

---

#### 4. robots.txt Optimization
**File:** `public/robots.txt`

```txt
# Find My Mosque - Robots.txt
# Updated: 2025-10-07

# Sitemap location
Sitemap: https://findmymosque.org/sitemap.xml

# General crawl delay
Crawl-delay: 1

# Google (highest priority - no delay)
User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /
Crawl-delay: 0

# Bing
User-agent: Bingbot
Allow: /
Crawl-delay: 1

# Social media bots (for previews)
User-agent: Twitterbot
Allow: /

User-agent: facebookexternalhit
Allow: /
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Search engines know where sitemap is located
- ✅ Polite crawling (no server overload)
- ✅ Priority for Google & Bing
- ✅ Social media preview support

## Halal Supermarket Finder

### Complete Implementation Guide

---

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED ✅)

#### Database Setup

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/001_create_supermarkets_table.sql`

```sql
-- Enable PostGIS for geospatial queries
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;

-- Supermarkets table
CREATE TABLE supermarkets (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
  chain TEXT NOT NULL,
  has_halal_section BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  confidence_score NUMERIC(3,2) CHECK (confidence_score >= 0 AND confidence_score <= 1),
  reasoning TEXT,
  source TEXT DEFAULT 'Google Places + Claude AI',
  google_rating NUMERIC(2,1),
  google_review_count INTEGER,
  last_verified TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for fast geospatial queries
CREATE INDEX idx_supermarkets_location ON supermarkets USING GIST(location);

-- Index for chain filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_supermarkets_chain ON supermarkets(chain);

-- Index for confidence filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_supermarkets_confidence ON supermarkets(confidence_score);

-- Row Level Security Policies
ALTER TABLE supermarkets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read access (anyone can view)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON supermarkets
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Authenticated write access (only logged-in users can add/edit)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated write access" ON supermarkets
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated update access" ON supermarkets
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Scrape logs table (for automation tracking)
CREATE TABLE scrape_logs (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,

  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('running', 'completed', 'failed')),
  supermarkets_processed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  errors JSONB
);

-- RLS for scrape_logs (admin only)
ALTER TABLE scrape_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Admin access only" ON scrape_logs
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

---

#### Test Data Insertion

```sql
-- Insert 3 test supermarkets in Sydney
INSERT INTO supermarkets (name, address, location, chain, has_halal_section, confidence_score, reasoning, google_rating, google_review_count)
VALUES
  (
    'Coles Lakemba',
    '100 Haldon St, Lakemba NSW 2195',
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(151.0751, -33.9181), 4326)::geography,
    'Coles',
    true,
    0.95,
    'Large halal section confirmed by community feedback and store signage. Multiple reviews mention extensive halal meat selection.',
    4.5,
    123
  ),
  (
    'Woolworths Auburn',
    '40 Queen St, Auburn NSW 2144',
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(151.0323, -33.8486), 4326)::geography,
    'Woolworths',
    true,
    0.88,
    'Halal section present with various products. Community members report dedicated halal meat area.',
    4.2,
    89
  ),
  (
    'IGA Punchbowl',
    '1355 Canterbury Rd, Punchbowl NSW 2196',
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(151.0536, -33.9292), 4326)::geography,
    'IGA',
    true,
    0.72,
    'Limited halal products mentioned in reviews. Some customers report halal meat availability but selection may vary.',
    4.0,
    67
  );
```

---

#### Frontend Component

**File:** `src/pages/HalalSupermarkets.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- Statistics dashboard (total, halal count, high confidence count)
- Filter controls (halal-only checkbox, confidence slider, chain dropdown)
- Supermarket cards with all details
- Google Maps directions integration
- Responsive design (3-2-1 column grid)

**State Management:**
```tsx
const [supermarkets, setSupermarkets] = useState([]);
const [filteredSupermarkets, setFilteredSupermarkets] = useState([]);
const [showHalalOnly, setShowHalalOnly] = useState(true);
const [minConfidence, setMinConfidence] = useState(70);
const [selectedChain, setSelectedChain] = useState('All');
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
```

**Filtering Logic:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  let filtered = supermarkets;

  // Filter by halal section
  if (showHalalOnly) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(s => s.has_halal_section);
  }

  // Filter by confidence
  filtered = filtered.filter(s =>
    (s.confidence_score * 100) >= minConfidence
  );

  // Filter by chain
  if (selectedChain !== 'All') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(s => s.chain === selectedChain);
  }

  setFilteredSupermarkets(filtered);
}, [supermarkets, showHalalOnly, minConfidence, selectedChain]);
```

**Confidence Badge Component:**
```tsx
const getConfidenceBadge = (score: number) => {
  const percentage = Math.round(score * 100);

  if (percentage >= 90) {
    return <span className="bg-green-100 text-green-800">High Confidence • {percentage}%</span>;
  } else if (percentage >= 80) {
    return <span className="bg-blue-100 text-blue-800">Good Confidence • {percentage}%</span>;
  } else if (percentage >= 70) {
    return <span className="bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800">Medium Confidence • {percentage}%</span>;
  } else {
    return <span className="bg-orange-100 text-orange-800">Low Confidence • {percentage}%</span>;
  }
};
```

### Phase 2: Google Places Integration (PENDING)

**Objective:** Automatically fetch supermarkets from Google Places API

**Implementation Plan:**

#### 1. Supabase Edge Function
**File:** `supabase/functions/fetch-supermarkets/index.ts`

```typescript
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts';
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2';

serve(async (req) => {
  const { location, radius } = await req.json();

  // Initialize Supabase client
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  );

  // Fetch supermarkets from Google Places API
  const googleApiKey = Deno.env.get('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY');
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?` +
    `location=${location.lat},${location.lng}&` +
    `radius=${radius}&` +
    `type=supermarket&` +
    `key=${googleApiKey}`
  );

  const data = await response.json();

  // Process results
  const supermarkets = data.results.map((place: any) => ({
    name: place.name,
    address: place.vicinity,
    location: {
      lat: place.geometry.location.lat,
      lng: place.geometry.location.lng
    },
    google_place_id: place.place_id,
    google_rating: place.rating,
    google_review_count: place.user_ratings_total
  }));

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(supermarkets), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
});
```

#### 2. Store Supermarkets in Database
```typescript
// For each supermarket from Google Places
for (const supermarket of supermarkets) {
  // Check if already exists
  const { data: existing } = await supabase
    .from('supermarkets')
    .select('id')
    .eq('name', supermarket.name)
    .eq('address', supermarket.address)
    .single();

  if (!existing) {
    // Insert new supermarket
    await supabase.from('supermarkets').insert({
      name: supermarket.name,
      address: supermarket.address,
      location: `POINT(${supermarket.location.lng} ${supermarket.location.lat})`,
      chain: detectChain(supermarket.name), // Helper function
      google_rating: supermarket.google_rating,
      google_review_count: supermarket.google_review_count,
      has_halal_section: false, // Phase 3 will determine this
      confidence_score: 0
    });
  }
}
```

**Cost Estimate:**
- Nearby Search: $0.032 per request
- Place Details: $0.017 per request
- 10,000 supermarkets × $0.049 = ~$490 one-time
- Weekly updates: ~100 stores × $0.049 = ~$5/week

---

### Phase 3: Claude AI Halal Detection (PENDING)

**Objective:** Analyze reviews to detect halal section presence

**Implementation Plan:**

#### 1. Fetch Reviews from Google
```typescript
async function fetchReviews(placeId: string) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?` +
    `place_id=${placeId}&` +
    `fields=reviews&` +
    `key=${googleApiKey}`
  );

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result.reviews || [];
}
```

#### 2. Analyze with Claude AI
```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

async function analyzeForHalal(reviews: any[]) {
  const anthropic = new Anthropic({
    apiKey: Deno.env.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
  });

  // Combine relevant review text
  const reviewText = reviews
    .map(r => r.text)
    .join('\n\n');

  const prompt = `
    Analyze these supermarket reviews and determine:
    1. Does this store have a halal section? (yes/no/unclear)
    2. Confidence level (0-100%)
    3. Brief reasoning (1-2 sentences)

    Reviews:
    ${reviewText}

    Respond in JSON format:
    {
      "has_halal": boolean,
      "confidence": number,
      "reasoning": string
    }
  `;

  const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
    max_tokens: 300,
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: prompt
    }]
  });

  return JSON.parse(message.content[0].text);
}
```

#### 3. Update Database
```typescript
const analysis = await analyzeForHalal(reviews);

await supabase
  .from('supermarkets')
  .update({
    has_halal_section: analysis.has_halal,
    confidence_score: analysis.confidence / 100,
    reasoning: analysis.reasoning,
    last_verified: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', supermarketId);
```

**Cost Estimate:**
- Claude Sonnet: $3.00 per million input tokens, $15.00 per million output tokens
- Average: 500 tokens input, 100 tokens output per supermarket
- 1,000 supermarkets: ~$2.10 total
- Weekly updates (100 stores): ~$0.21/week

---

### Phase 4: Weekly Automation (PENDING)

**Objective:** Automatically update supermarket data weekly

#### 1. Cron Job Setup
**File:** `supabase/functions/_shared/cron.ts`

```typescript
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts';
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2';

// Runs every Sunday at 2 AM
serve(async (req) => {
  // Log scrape start
  const { data: log } = await supabase
    .from('scrape_logs')
    .insert({ status: 'running' })
    .select()
    .single();

  try {
    // 1. Fetch new supermarkets from Google Places
    const newSupermarkets = await fetchSupermarketsFromGoogle();

    // 2. For each supermarket, analyze reviews with Claude
    for (const supermarket of newSupermarkets) {
      const reviews = await fetchReviews(supermarket.google_place_id);
      const analysis = await analyzeForHalal(reviews);

      await updateSupermarketInDatabase(supermarket, analysis);
    }

    // 3. Update existing supermarkets (re-verify)
    const existingSupermarkets = await getStaleSuperm arkets(); // Not verified in 30 days
    for (const supermarket of existingSupermarkets) {
      const reviews = await fetchReviews(supermarket.google_place_id);
      const analysis = await analyzeForHalal(reviews);

      await updateSupermarketInDatabase(supermarket, analysis);
    }

    // Log completion
    await supabase
      .from('scrape_logs')
      .update({
        status: 'completed',
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        supermarkets_processed: newSupermarkets.length + existingSupermarkets.length
      })
      .eq('id', log.id);

  } catch (error) {
    // Log failure
    await supabase
      .from('scrape_logs')
      .update({
        status: 'failed',
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        errors: { message: error.message }
      })
      .eq('id', log.id);
  }

  return new Response('Scrape completed', { status: 200 });
});
```

#### 2. Configure in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions
2. Create new function: `weekly-supermarket-update`
3. Deploy the cron function
4. Set trigger: `0 2 * * 0` (Every Sunday at 2 AM)

**Weekly Cost:**
- Google Places API: ~$5 (100 updates)
- Claude AI: ~$0.21 (100 reviews analyzed)
- **Total: ~$5.21/week (~$22/month)**

## Mobile Optimization Details

### Responsive Navigation Implementation

**File:** `src/components/TransparentNavbar.tsx`

#### Desktop Navigation (≥768px)
- Horizontal navigation bar
- Dropdown menu for "Browse by State"
- Hover effects on all items
- All options visible

#### Mobile Navigation (<768px)
- Hamburger icon (≡) in top-left
- Slide-down menu on tap
- Full-width menu items
- Touch-friendly tap targets (≥44px)
- Click-outside to close

#### Implementation Details

**State Management:**
```tsx
const [isMobileMenuOpen, setIsMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const [isCityMenuOpen, setIsCityMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const mobileMenuRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
```

**Click-Outside Detection:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    if (
      mobileMenuRef.current &&
      !mobileMenuRef.current.contains(event.target as Node)
    ) {
      setIsMobileMenuOpen(false);
      setIsCityMenuOpen(false);
    }
  };

  if (isMobileMenuOpen) {
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  }

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  };
}, [isMobileMenuOpen]);
```

**Hamburger Icon:**
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => setIsMobileMenuOpen(!isMobileMenuOpen)}
  className="md:hidden p-2"
  aria-label="Toggle menu"
>
  {isMobileMenuOpen ? (
    <X className="h-6 w-6 text-gray-900" />
  ) : (
    <Menu className="h-6 w-6 text-gray-900" />
  )}
</button>
```

---

### Favicon Implementation

**File:** `index.html`

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/logo.png" />
```

**Current Favicon:**
- File: `public/logo.png`
- Size: 1.12MB (large - consider optimizing to ~50KB)
- Format: PNG
- Appears in browser tabs and bookmarks

**Future Optimization:**
```bash
# Compress favicon (optional)
npx sharp-cli \
  --input public/logo.png \
  --output public/favicon.png \
  --resize 32 \
  --quality 90
```

---

## Automation

### Sitemap Auto-Generation

**Trigger:** Every `npm run build`

**Process:**
1. `prebuild` script executes
2. Runs `generate-sitemap.js`
3. Validates `sitemap-config.js`
4. Writes to `public/sitemap.xml`
5. Build continues with fresh sitemap

**Manual Generation:**
```bash
npm run generate-sitemap
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Suburb Autocomplete Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- No dropdown appears when typing
- Console errors about CORS
- Empty results

**Solution:**
1. Check Edge Functions are deployed to Supabase:
```bash
supabase functions list
# Should show: autocomplete-suburb, geocode-place, validate-postcode
```

2. Verify Google Places API is enabled:
- Go to Google Cloud Console
- Navigate to APIs & Services → Library
- Search "Places API"
- Ensure it's enabled

3. Check API key is in Supabase secrets:
```bash
supabase secrets list
# Should show: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
```

4. Deploy Edge Functions if missing:
```bash
supabase functions deploy autocomplete-suburb
supabase functions deploy geocode-place
supabase functions deploy validate-postcode
```

---

### Build Fails with ES Module Error

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "require is not defined in ES module scope"
- `generate-sitemap.js` fails

**Solution:**
Ensure `package.json` has `"type": "module"` and all scripts use ES modules:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct (ES modules)
import { BASE_URL, routes } from './sitemap-config.js';
export { BASE_URL, routes };

// ❌ Wrong (CommonJS)
const { BASE_URL, routes } = require('./sitemap-config.js');
module.exports = { BASE_URL, routes };
```

---

### Dropdown Menu Won't Close

**Symptoms:**
- State dropdown stays open after clicking elsewhere
- No way to close except refreshing page

**Solution:**
Add click-outside detection with useRef + useEffect:

```tsx
const dropdownRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const handleClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    if (dropdownRef.current && !dropdownRef.current.contains(event.target as Node)) {
      setIsOpen(false);
    }
  };

  if (isOpen) {
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  }

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  };
}, [isOpen]);
```

---

### Sitemap Not Updating

**Symptoms:**
- Added new page but not in sitemap
- Old lastmod dates

**Solution:**
1. Check if page is in `scripts/sitemap-config.js`
2. Run `npm run generate-sitemap` manually
3. Check `public/sitemap.xml` was updated
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`

---

### Halal Supermarkets Page Shows 0-0-0 Statistics

**Symptoms:**
- Statistics dashboard shows all zeros
- No supermarket cards appear

**Solution:**
1. Check database has data:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supermarkets;
-- Should return 3 (or more)
```

2. Check Supabase connection:
```tsx
// In HalalSupermarkets.tsx
console.log('Supabase URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('Fetched supermarkets:', supermarkets);
```

3. Check RLS policies allow public read:
```sql
SELECT * FROM supermarkets;
-- Should work without authentication
```

## Mosque Email Extraction System

### Overview

**Purpose:** Extract and maintain mosque email addresses for marketing campaigns (cold outreach to promote findmymosque.org)

**Privacy:** Email data stored in PRIVATE Supabase table (no public access)

**Created:** October 10, 2025

---

### Architecture

**Pipeline:**
1. Extract mosques from Google Maps (Apify: `compass/google-maps-extractor`)
2. Scrape emails from mosque websites (Apify: `apify/website-content-crawler`)
3. Scrape emails from Facebook pages (fallback, optional)
4. Validate emails using DNS MX records (free, no API cost)
5. Store in Supabase `mosques_emails` table

**Target:** 300+ mosques across Australia

---

### Apify Actor Testing Results (October 24, 2025)

**Comprehensive testing of 4 Apify actors to determine best email extraction method:**

#### Test 1: Google Maps Email Extractor
- **Actor:** `lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details`
- **Test Size:** 50 mosques
- **Method:** Extract emails from Google Maps Place IDs
- **Result:** 0 emails (0% success)
- **Finding:** ❌ Google Maps listings do not contain email addresses
- **Cost:** ~$0.45

#### Test 2: Website Content Crawler ✅ RECOMMENDED
- **Actor:** `apify/website-content-crawler`
- **Test 1:** 50 mosques → 2 emails (5% success)
- **Test 2:** 100 mosques → 4 mosques with 7 emails (5% success)
- **Method:** Scrape website text content, extract emails using regex
- **Regex Pattern:** `/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/g`
- **Email Filtering:** Excludes example.com, sentry.io, google, facebook, wix.com
- **Result:** ✅ 5% success rate (consistent across tests)
- **Cost:** $0.72 for 100 websites
- **Projection:** 211 websites → ~11 emails for $1.90
- **Settings:** `maxCrawlDepth: 0` (homepage only), `crawlerType: 'cheerio'` (fast)

**Successful Extractions:**
1. PGCC (VIC) - administration@pgcc.org.au
2. Australia Light Foundation (VIC) - office@australialightfoundation.com.au
3. Masjid Darul IMAAN (NSW) - info@imaan.com.au
4. Indonesia Community (VIC) - 4 emails (masjid.westall@, baitul.makmur@, surau.kita@, info@)

#### Test 3: Google Maps → Facebook → Email (2-Step)
- **Actors:** `compass/crawler-google-places` + `apify/facebook-page-contact-information`
- **Test Size:** 50 mosques
- **Step 1 Result:** 2 Facebook URLs found (4% of mosques link Facebook in Google Maps)
- **Step 2 Result:** 1 page scraped, 0 emails
- **Finding:** ❌ Most mosques don't link Facebook in Google Maps listings
- **Cost:** ~$0.45

#### Test 4: Facebook Pages Scraper
- **Actor:** `apify/facebook-pages-scraper`
- **Test Size:** General search for Australian mosques
- **Search Queries:** "mosque Sydney Australia", "masjid Melbourne", etc.
- **Result:** 1 result found, 0 Australian mosques identified, 0 emails
- **Finding:** ❌ Requires Facebook login credentials (security risk)
- **Cost:** ~$0.01

**Conclusion:**
- ✅ **Website Content Crawler is the ONLY viable method** (5% success rate)
- ❌ Google Maps does not contain email data
- ❌ Facebook scraping requires login (security risk) and low mosque coverage
- **Recommendation:** Scrape all 211 mosque websites for ~$1.90 to get ~11 emails
- **Alternative:** Use 232 phone numbers in database for direct outreach

**Files Created:**
- `docs/website_emails_test.csv` - 100 mosques tested, 4 with emails
- `scripts/apify-email-test.ts` - Google Maps email extraction test

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install apify-client tsx
```

#### 2. Get Apify API Token

1. Go to [console.apify.com/account/integrations](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations)
2. Copy your API token
3. Add to `.env`:

```bash
APIFY_TOKEN="YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN_HERE"
```

#### 3. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Via Supabase CLI
supabase migration up

# Or run SQL directly in Supabase Dashboard
```

Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251010_create_mosques_emails_table.sql`

---

### Usage

#### One-Time Extraction

```bash
npm run extract-emails
```

**What happens:**
1. Searches 16 locations across Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, regional areas)
2. Extracts 300+ mosques from Google Maps
3. Scrapes emails from mosque websites
4. Validates emails using DNS MX records
5. Uploads to Supabase `mosques_emails` table
6. Generates final report

**Duration:** ~30-60 minutes (depending on network speed)

**Cost Estimate:**
- Google Maps extraction: ~$8-12
- Website scraping: ~$12-23
- **Total: ~$20-35 (one-time)**

---

### Email Validation

**Method:** DNS MX Record Lookup

**How it works:**
1. Extract domain from email (e.g., `info@mosque.org.au` → `mosque.org.au`)
2. Query DNS for MX (mail exchange) records
3. If MX records exist → email domain is valid
4. Mark as `verified: true` or `verified: false`

**Advantages:**
- ✅ 100% free (no API costs)
- ✅ Fast (100ms per email)
- ✅ Accurate (~95% accuracy)
- ✅ No rate limits

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't test if inbox exists (only domain validity)
- Won't catch typos in local part (e.g., `inffo@mosque.org.au`)

---

### Search Queries Used

**Major Cities (Tier 1):**
- Sydney, NSW
- Melbourne, VIC
- Brisbane, QLD
- Perth, WA
- Adelaide, SA
- Canberra, ACT

**Regional Areas (Tier 2):**
- Gold Coast, QLD
- Newcastle, NSW
- Hobart, TAS
- Darwin, NT

**Search Terms:**
- "mosque OR masjid OR Islamic centre"
- "Islamic center" (American spelling)
- "prayer hall"
- "Muslim community centre"

---

### Data Export for Make.com/n8n

#### Option 1: SQL Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_verified_emails_for_export();
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "mosque_name": "Lakemba Mosque",
  "email": "info@lakembamosque.org.au",
  "location": "65-67 Wangee Rd, Lakemba NSW 2195",
  "phone": "(02) 9740 9831",
  "state": "NSW",
  "website": "https://lakembamosque.org.au"
}
```

#### Option 2: Supabase REST API

```bash
# Get all verified emails
curl 'https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/mosques_emails?email_verified=eq.true&select=name,email_primary,location,phone,state' \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```

#### Option 3: CSV Export

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Table Editor → `mosques_emails`
3. Apply filter: `email_verified = true`
4. Click "Export" → "CSV"

---

### Monitoring & Statistics

#### View Extraction Stats

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_email_extraction_stats();
```

**Returns:**
- Total mosques
- Mosques with primary/secondary/tertiary emails
- Verified email count
- Breakdown by state

#### Check Last Extraction

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_mosques,
  COUNT(email_primary) as with_email,
  MAX(last_updated) as last_run
FROM mosques_emails;
```

---

### Cost Breakdown

**One-Time Extraction (300+ mosques):**
- Google Maps Extractor: ~$10 (16 searches × 50-100 results each)
- Website Content Crawler: ~$15 (200 websites × 7 pages each)
- Facebook Pages Scraper: ~$5 (50 pages, optional)
- Email Validation: $0 (free DNS lookup)
- **Total: ~$25-30**

**Apify Free Tier:**
- $5 free credits per month
- Good for testing with 50-100 mosques

---

### Troubleshooting

#### "Missing APIFY_TOKEN" Error

**Solution:** Add your Apify token to `.env`:
```bash
APIFY_TOKEN="apify_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

#### "No mosques found" Error

**Possible causes:**
1. Apify account has no credits
2. Actor name changed (check Apify docs)
3. Network/firewall blocking API requests

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Apify credits
# Go to: https://console.apify.com/billing
```

#### "Database connection failed"

**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong Supabase credentials in `.env`
2. RLS policies blocking service role
3. Table doesn't exist

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify env variables
echo $VITE_SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY

# Run migration
supabase migration up
```

#### Low Extraction Rate (<30% emails found)

**Possible causes:**
1. Mosques don't have websites
2. Websites don't list emails (only contact forms)
3. Emails hidden behind JavaScript

**Solution:**
- Use Facebook scraper as fallback
- Manually add emails for high-priority mosques
- Consider phone-based outreach

---

### Security Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep `APIFY_TOKEN` in `.env` (never commit to Git)
- ✅ Use service role key for scripts (not anon key)
- ✅ Ensure `mosques_emails` table has RLS enabled
- ✅ Export emails only when needed (no permanent local copies)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Expose email table via public API
- ❌ Share email list publicly or with third parties
- ❌ Store emails in frontend code
- ❌ Commit `.env` file to Git

---

### Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
1. **SMTP Verification:** Test if inboxes actually exist (~$0.001/email via ZeroBounce)
2. **Auto-refresh:** Re-validate emails quarterly (mosques change emails)
3. **Phone Extraction:** Also extract phone numbers from websites
4. **Social Media:** Extract Instagram, Twitter handles
5. **Contact Preference:** Detect preferred contact method from website

### Halal Business Cross-Promotion Template

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - Halal Directory Cross-Promotion

**Body:**
```
Assalamu Alaikum [Business Name] Team,

I'm Zubair, founder of Find My Mosque (findmymosque.org), Australia's largest mosque directory.

We're launching a **Halal Supermarkets Directory** (similar to our mosque finder) that will help Australian Muslims discover halal food sources across the country.

I'd love to feature [Business Name] in our directory. In exchange, would you be open to:

This is a mutually beneficial partnership supporting the Australian Muslim community.

Would you be interested in discussing this further?

JazakAllah Khair,
Zubair

## Mobile Navigation Bug Fixes

### October 19, 2025 - Browse by State Dropdown Fix

**Problem:** Mobile "Browse by State" dropdown was not working when users clicked on state options. Navigation failed completely on mobile devices.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. React Router `navigate()` function not working in mobile hamburger menu
2. Dropdown positioning issues causing NSW and Victoria to be cut off above viewport
3. Modal overflow positioning calculations failing on mobile browsers

**Solution Implemented:**
Created dedicated mobile "Browse by State" button in navbar (separate from hamburger menu) with proper positioning.

**Technical Changes in `src/components/TransparentNavbar.tsx`:**

1. **New Mobile Button in Navbar** (lines 61-104)
   - Added between hamburger menu and desktop navigation
   - Only visible on mobile (`md:hidden`)
   - Uses teal-600 theme matching homepage design

2. **Dropdown Positioning**
   - Container: `relative` positioning
   - Dropdown: `absolute top-full right-0` (appears directly below button)
   - Max height: `60vh` with `overflow-y-auto` for scrolling
   - Z-index: 999999 to ensure visibility above all content

3. **Click-to-Close Logic**
   - `stopPropagation()` on dropdown prevents overlay clicks from closing menu
   - State management with `isMobileCityMenuOpen` boolean
   - Updated `useEffect` to handle click-outside detection for new button

4. **Removed from Hamburger Menu**
   - Deleted "Browse by State" from mobile hamburger menu (was causing navigation failures)
   - Hamburger now only contains: Home, Halal Markets, FAQ, Imam Profiles, Feedback

**Design Specifications:**
- Button: teal-600 background, white text, rounded-lg, shadow-lg
- Dropdown header: teal-600 with "Select a State" title
- Dropdown items: white background, hover:teal-600, text-gray-900
- Border: 4px solid teal-800 (dark green)
- Font: font-serif for headers, font-medium for items (matches homepage)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 6 states visible and clickable (NSW, Victoria, Queensland, WA, SA, Tasmania)
- ✅ Desktop navigation unchanged and working
- ✅ Mobile dropdown appears/closes correctly
- ✅ State navigation works on mobile (confirmed in Chrome DevTools + user testing)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/TransparentNavbar.tsx` (52 insertions, 36 deletions)

**Deployed:** Commit f66ba00, merged to main, deployed to findmymosque.org

**Key Learning:**
React Router's `navigate()` function in mobile hamburger menus can fail on mobile browsers. Solution: Use dedicated buttons with `<a href>` tags or separate positioning for critical mobile navigation actions.
