## 🔄 Alternative Approach: Free Puppeteer Email Scraper

**Added:** October 11, 2025

### Why the Pivot?

Apify's free tier (8GB memory) proved insufficient for large-scale website scraping. Rather than paying $49/month for upgrades, we're building a custom solution using free, open-source tools.

### New Technical Stack

**Tools:**
- **Puppeteer:** Open-source browser automation (free)
- **DNS Validator:** Existing MX record validation (free, already built)
- **Supabase:** Database storage (free tier, already using)
- **TypeScript:** Custom scraping logic

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Database Setup**
- Create `marketing_prospects` table
- Store all 337 mosques with full data
- Fields: name, address, phone, website, email, state, coordinates
- RLS-protected (marketing use only)

**Phase 2: Data Import**
- Import from `gmaps-results.json`
- Validate data integrity
- Set `extraction_status = 'pending'` for websites

**Phase 3: Email Scraping**
- Launch Puppeteer for each website
- Extract emails using regex: `/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/g`
- Validate with DNS MX records
- Update database with results
- Respectful delays (3 seconds between requests)

**Phase 4: Verification & Export**
- Review extracted emails
- Export verified list for campaigns
- Generate statistics report

### Benefits Over Apify

| Feature | Apify Paid | Puppeteer Custom |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Cost | $49/month | $0 |
| Control | Limited | Full |
| Pause/Resume | Limited | Anytime |
| Customization | Restricted | Unlimited |
| Data Storage | Separate | Supabase (free) |
| Integration | API calls | Direct database |

### Expected Results

- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours automated execution
- **Success Rate:** 60-70% (similar to Apify)
- **Verified Emails:** 120-150
- **Phone Numbers:** 232 (bonus alternative contact method)
- **Total Cost:** $0

### Scripts to Create

1. `scripts/marketing/create-prospects-table.sql` - Database migration
2. `scripts/marketing/import-prospects.ts` - Import JSON → Supabase
3. `scripts/marketing/scrape-emails.ts` - Puppeteer scraper
4. `scripts/marketing/export-results.ts` - Export for campaigns

### Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

# Run migration
npm run db:migrate

# Import mosque data
npm run import-prospects

# Scrape emails (automated, 2-3 hours)
