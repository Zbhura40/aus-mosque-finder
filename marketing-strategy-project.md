### Campaign Overview

Backlink building is now the **primary SEO focus** for the next 2 months. This campaign runs parallel to other marketing efforts but takes priority due to its long-term SEO impact.

**Why Backlinks Matter:**
- Google uses backlinks as the #1 ranking signal for domain authority
- Quality backlinks = higher search rankings = more organic traffic
- Each high-quality backlink compounds over time (permanent value)
- Target: Move from current state (few/spam backlinks) to 30-50 trusted Australian Islamic/community sources

**Campaign Philosophy:**
- Quality over quantity (one DA 50 link > ten DA 10 links)
- Relevance is critical (Islamic/Australian sources preferred)
- Only ethical, white-hat tactics (no buying links, no spam)
- Sustainable approach (relationships, not transactions)
