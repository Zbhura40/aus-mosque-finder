# Find My Mosque - Project Notes

## Session Summary (2025-10-06)

This document captures the comprehensive work completed during the SEO improvement and redesign phase.

---

## 1. Initial Context & Safety Check

**Issue**: User had test files from design experiments that needed to be removed to keep only live site code.

**Action**: Removed test files while preserving CLAUDE.md and .mcp.json (kept private).

---

## 2. SEO Improvement Plan

**Goal**: Rank on Google's first page for mosque-related searches in Australia.

**Deliverable**: Created SEO_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.txt with 4-week roadmap.

### Week 1: Image Optimization & Performance ✅
- Implemented vite-plugin-imagemin for automatic compression
- Achieved 55-78% file size reduction (e.g., og-image.jpg: 189KB → 42KB)
- Added code splitting with React vendor bundles

### Week 2: Technical SEO & Meta Tags ✅
- Updated index.html with proper meta tags (locale: en-AU, keywords, canonical URLs)
- Fixed Open Graph tags and Twitter cards
- Replaced og-image.jpg with Happy.jpg from Mosque photos folder
- Added resource preloading for fonts and DNS prefetch

### Week 3: City-Specific Landing Pages ✅
- Created 5 city pages: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide

4. Fixed z-index layering (z-50 for dropdown, z-40 for backdrop)
5. Added pt-20 padding to all pages to prevent navbar overlap

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
const [isCityMenuOpen, setIsCityMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const cities = [
  { name: "Sydney", path: "/mosques-sydney" },
  { name: "Melbourne", path: "/mosques-melbourne" },
  { name: "Brisbane", path: "/mosques-brisbane" },
  { name: "Perth", path: "/mosques-perth" },
  { name: "Adelaide", path: "/mosques-adelaide" }
];
```

---

## 4. BestDubai.com Design Pattern Integration

**Reference Site Analysis**: Scraped BestDubai.com to extract design patterns.

**Design Specifications Applied**:
- **Grid Layout**: 3-column responsive (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
- **Font Sizes**:
  - H1: text-2xl md:text-3xl
  - H2: text-xl
  - Body: text-sm
  - Details: text-xs

// Filtering logic:
.filter(mosque => selectedRegion === null || mosque.region === selectedRegion)
```

### 5.3 Google Ratings Integration

## 12. Technical Concepts Explained

### What is SEO?
Search Engine Optimization - making your website easier for Google to understand and rank higher in search results.

### What is JSON-LD Schema?
A way to tell Google exactly what your page contains (like a nutrition label for websites). Helps Google show rich snippets in search results.

### What is Code Splitting?
Breaking your website into smaller chunks that load separately. Makes the initial page load faster.

### What is Image Optimization?
Compressing images to smaller file sizes without losing quality. Faster loading = better SEO + better user experience.

### What is a Canonical URL?
Tells Google which version of a page is the "official" one (prevents duplicate content issues).

### What is Open Graph?
Meta tags that control how your website looks when shared on social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).

## 20. Google Places API Integration (2025-10-06)

### Implementation Approach: Option 3 - Pre-fetch & Store (Secure)

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ **Security First**: API key never exposed to users (stored in .env.local)
- ✅ **Cost Effective**: No ongoing API costs during normal site usage (~$0.78/month if run monthly)
- ✅ **Full Control**: User decides when to update data
- ✅ **Fast Performance**: Data pre-loaded, no API calls during page load
- ✅ **No Client-Side Risks**: API key only used when running manual script

### Files Created

**1. `scripts/fetch-mosque-data.js`**
- Node.js script to fetch data from Google Places API
- Features:
  - Text Search to find mosques by name + address
  - Place Details to get ratings, hours, categories, attributes
  - Rate limiting (200ms delay between requests)
  - Error handling for missing/not found mosques
  - Saves to `src/data/mosques-data.json`
- Usage: `npm run fetch-mosque-data`

**2. `src/data/mosques-data.json`**

- Contains for each mosque:
  - Basic info: name, address, phone, website, region
  - Google ratings (where available)
  - Opening hours (7-day schedule)
  - Current open/closed status
  - Categories (place_of_worship, mosque, etc.)
  - Attributes (wheelchair accessible, women's prayer area, etc.)

**3. `.env.local.example`**
- Template for environment variables
- Shows format: `VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Reminds never to commit .env.local

**4. `GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md`**
- Complete beginner-friendly setup guide
- Covers:
  - How to get Google Places API key
  - Security settings (API restrictions, IP restrictions)
  - How to add key to .env.local
  - How to run the script
  - Cost breakdown (~$0.78/month)

  ],
  "currentlyOpen": true,
  "categories": ["place_of_worship", "mosque", "point_of_interest"],
  "attributes": ["Wheelchair accessible", "Women's prayer area", "Operational"]
}
```

### Security Implementation

**Protection Measures:**
1. `.env.local` in `.gitignore` (never committed)

## 26. Australian Suburb Autocomplete Feature (Session 4, 2025-10-06)

### Objective
Enhance postcode input with Australian suburb autocomplete and validation to improve user experience when searching for mosques.

### Implementation Details

**File:** `src/components/MosqueLocator.tsx`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Button Text Update:**
   - From: "Enter Postcode"
   - To: "Enter Postcode or Suburb"

2. **Placeholder Text Update:**
   - From: "Enter postcode (e.g., 4103)"
   - To: "Enter any postcode or suburb"

3. **New TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
interface SuburbSuggestion {
  description: string;
  place_id: string;
}
```

4. **New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [suburbSuggestions, setSuburbSuggestions] = useState<SuburbSuggestion[]>([]);
const [showSuggestions, setShowSuggestions] = useState(false);
const [isValidLocation, setIsValidLocation] = useState(true);
```

5. **Enhanced `handlePostcodeChange` Function:**
   - Calls Google Places Autocomplete API when user types 2+ characters
   - Filters results for Australian suburbs only
   - Updates suggestions state with matching results
   - Shows dropdown if predictions found
   - Resets validation state on input change

6. **New `handleSuburbSelect` Function:**
   - Handles selection from dropdown
   - Updates input with selected suburb
   - Calls geocoding API to get place details
   - Closes dropdown and clears suggestions
   - Updates display with suburb name

7. **Dropdown UI:**
```typescript
{showSuggestions && suburbSuggestions.length > 0 && (
  <div className="absolute z-50 w-full mt-1 bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-h-60 overflow-y-auto">
    {suburbSuggestions.map((suggestion) => (
      <button
        key={suggestion.place_id}
        onClick={() => handleSuburbSelect(suggestion)}
        className="w-full text-left px-4 py-3 hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150 text-sm text-gray-700 border-b border-gray-100 last:border-b-0"
      >
        {suggestion.description}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

8. **Validation Highlighting:**
```typescript
className={`h-11 text-sm rounded-lg border focus:ring-1 ${
  !isValidLocation
    ? 'border-red-500 focus:border-red-500 focus:ring-red-500'
    : 'border-gray-300 focus:border-teal-600 focus:ring-teal-600'
}`}
```

#### Features:

✅ **Real-time Autocomplete:**
- Shows suggestions after 2+ characters
- Filters for Australian locations only
- Dropdown appears below input field
- Scrollable list for multiple results

✅ **Validation:**
- Red border when location is invalid
- Green/teal border for valid input
- Visual feedback improves UX

✅ **Smart Filtering:**
- Only shows dropdown if matching suburbs found
- No dropdown for invalid/non-matching input
- Automatically hides after selection

✅ **API Integration:**
- Uses Supabase Edge Functions:
  - `autocomplete-suburb`: Gets suburb suggestions
  - `geocode-place`: Gets place details from place_id
- Secure implementation (API key in backend)

#### User Flow:

1. User clicks "Enter Postcode or Suburb" button
2. Input field appears with placeholder text
3. User starts typing (e.g., "Melb")
4. After 2 characters, dropdown shows:
   - Melbourne VIC, Australia
   - Melba ACT, Australia
   - Melbourne Airport VIC, Australia
5. User clicks desired suburb
6. Input fills with selected suburb
7. Dropdown closes
8. Mosque search proceeds with selected location

#### Error Handling:

- Try-catch blocks for API calls
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if API fails
- Validation state prevents invalid searches
