### 📱 Mobile Navigation Optimization

**Problem:**
- Desktop navigation not optimized for mobile screens
- Small touch targets difficult to use on phones
- State dropdown cluttered the navigation bar on mobile

**Solution: Hamburger Menu**
Implemented a mobile-responsive hamburger menu with full-featured navigation.

#### Implementation Details

**File:** `src/components/TransparentNavbar.tsx`

**New State & Refs:**
```typescript
const [isMobileMenuOpen, setIsMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const mobileMenuRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
```

**New Icons:**
- `Menu` - Hamburger icon (3 horizontal lines)
- `X` - Close icon for open menu state

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile (< md breakpoint): Shows hamburger icon only
- Desktop (≥ md breakpoint): Shows full navigation bar

#### Mobile Menu Features

**1. Hamburger Button:**
- Positioned top-left corner
- Toggle animation: Menu ↔ X icon
- Smooth transitions
- Hover effect: `bg-islamic-green/20`

**2. Full-Screen Mobile Menu:**
- Absolute positioning below navbar
- Backdrop blur effect: `backdrop-blur-md`
- Warm ivory background: `bg-warm-ivory/95`
- Drop shadow: `shadow-2xl`
- Rounded corners: `rounded-lg`

**3. Navigation Items:**
All desktop features available on mobile:
- Home (with Home icon)
- Browse by State (expandable with all 6 states)
  - New South Wales
  - Victoria
  - Queensland

**5. Nested State Selection:**
- Expandable "Browse by State" section
- ChevronDown icon rotates when expanded
- Indented state list (pl-12) for visual hierarchy
- Gray background: `bg-gray-50` for nested items
- Clicking state closes both menus and scrolls to top

**6. Click-Outside Handling:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    if (mobileMenuRef.current && !mobileMenuRef.current.contains(event.target as Node)) {
      setIsMobileMenuOpen(false);
    }
  };
  if (isMobileMenuOpen) {
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  }
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  };
}, [isMobileMenuOpen]);
```

#### Desktop Navigation (Unchanged)

Desktop navigation remains fully functional:

## Session Summary (2025-10-07) - Autocomplete Fix

This session focused on fixing the suburb autocomplete feature and deploying Supabase Edge Functions.

### 🐛 Issue Reported
User reported that the autocomplete feature on the homepage wasn't working when typing suburb names in the "Enter Postcode or Suburb" field.

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Problem 1: CORS Errors (Fixed)**
- Edge Functions existed locally but were NOT deployed to Supabase cloud
- Browser was trying to call functions at `https://mzqyswdfgimymxfhdyzw.supabase.co/functions/v1/`
- Functions didn't exist on server, causing CORS preflight failures
- Error: `Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status`

**Problem 2: Google Places API Not Enabled (Fixed by User)**
- API key was valid but didn't have "Places API" (legacy) enabled
- Google was returning: `REQUEST_DENIED` with error about legacy API not activated
- Once enabled, API started returning predictions successfully

### ✅ Solutions Implemented

**Step 1: Install Supabase CLI**
```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
# Version installed: 2.48.3
```

**Step 2: Fix Supabase Config File**
Updated `/supabase/config.toml` to be compatible with latest CLI:
- Changed `ip_version = "ipv4"` to `ip_version = "IPv4"`
- Removed deprecated keys: `realtime.port`, `auth.port`, `auth.enable_confirmations`

**Step 3: Link Project to Supabase**
```bash
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_4cbcc4d671162296e852d125dcef190c9079eb87
supabase link --project-ref mzqyswdfgimymxfhdyzw
```
Result: ✅ Project linked successfully

**Step 4: Set Google Maps API Key as Secret**
```bash
supabase secrets set GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBNugr4muApHZSGrHsN5SJ5YbBKyBCfh_A
```
Result: ✅ Secret stored securely in Supabase (never exposed to browser)

**Step 5: Deploy Edge Functions**
Deployed 3 functions to Supabase cloud:
```bash
supabase functions deploy autocomplete-suburb
supabase functions deploy geocode-place
supabase functions deploy geocode-postcode
```
All functions deployed successfully to: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mzqyswdfgimymxfhdyzw/functions`

**Step 6: Enable Google Places API**
User enabled "Places API" (legacy) in Google Cloud Console
- Verified with test API call - returned predictions for "Sydney"
- Status changed from `REQUEST_DENIED` to `OK`

**Step 7: Test Autocomplete Feature**
✅ Tested typing "Melb" in input field
✅ Dropdown appeared with 5 suggestions:
- Melbourne VIC, Australia
- Melbourne City, VIC, Australia
- Epping VIC, Australia
- Tarneit VIC, Australia
- Doncaster VIC, Australia

✅ Clicked suggestion "Melbourne VIC, Australia"
✅ Input updated correctly
✅ Display text showed "Melbourne, VIC"
✅ Dropdown closed as expected

### 📊 Verification Results

**Before Fix:**
- CORS errors in console
- No dropdown appearing
- API calls failing with 403/CORS errors
- Empty predictions: `{"predictions":[]}`

**After Fix:**
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ Dropdown appears with suggestions
- ✅ API calls returning 200 status
- ✅ Predictions populated with real data
- ✅ Selection updates input field correctly
- ✅ Geocoding works for selected suburb

### 🔐 Security Updates

**Added to .env file:**
```
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_4cbcc4d671162296e852d125dcef190c9079eb87
```
**Note:** This token is in `.gitignore` and NOT committed to repository

**Supabase Secrets Set:**
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Stored securely on Supabase server
- Other secrets auto-configured: SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_DB_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_URL

### 📦 Files Modified

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `supabase/config.toml` | Fixed deprecated config keys | CLI compatibility |
| `.env` | Added SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN | CLI authentication |

**Files Deployed (not modified):**
- `supabase/functions/autocomplete-suburb/index.ts` - Deployed to cloud
- `supabase/functions/geocode-place/index.ts` - Deployed to cloud
- `supabase/functions/geocode-postcode/index.ts` - Deployed to cloud

### 🎯 Feature Status: FULLY WORKING ✅

**Autocomplete Feature:**
- ✅ Triggers after typing 2+ characters
- ✅ Filters for Australian suburbs only
- ✅ Shows dropdown with 5 suggestions
- ✅ Updates input on selection
- ✅ Closes dropdown after selection
- ✅ Displays formatted location name
- ✅ Stores coordinates for mosque search

**User Experience:**
1. User types "Melb" → Dropdown appears instantly
2. User sees 5 Melbourne-related suggestions
3. User clicks "Melbourne VIC, Australia" → Input updates
4. User sees "Melbourne, VIC" confirmation below input
5. User can now click "Find Mosques" to search

### 💡 Technical Learnings

**What is Supabase CLI?**
A command-line tool that lets you manage your Supabase project from your computer. Think of it like a remote control for your Supabase backend.

**What are Edge Functions?**
Server-side code that runs on Supabase's servers (not your computer). They:
- Keep API keys secure (never exposed to users)
- Run closer to users for faster response
- Handle complex operations without slowing down your website

**Why CORS Errors Happen:**
Browsers block requests to servers that don't explicitly allow them (security feature). When functions aren't deployed, the server doesn't know how to handle the request, so it blocks it.

**Why Deploy Instead of Running Locally:**
- ✅ Works on live website (not just localhost)
- ✅ Available 24/7 (not just when your computer is on)
- ✅ Faster for users (runs on global servers)
- ✅ More secure (API keys hidden on server)

### 📈 Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **Add more Edge Functions:**
   - Deploy remaining functions: `search-mosques`, `get-mosque-photo`, etc.

2. **Monitor API Usage:**
   - Check Google Cloud Console for API call counts
   - Estimated cost: ~$0-5/month for Places API calls

3. **Add Error Handling:**
   - Show user-friendly messages if API fails
   - Add loading states for better UX

4. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Add caching for popular suburbs
   - Debounce API calls (currently at 200ms)

### 📝 Session Statistics

- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Files Modified:** 2 (config.toml, .env)
- **Functions Deployed:** 3 (autocomplete-suburb, geocode-place, geocode-postcode)
- **CLI Tools Installed:** 1 (Supabase CLI)
- **APIs Enabled:** 1 (Google Places API legacy)
- **Bugs Fixed:** 1 (Autocomplete not working)
- **Tests Performed:** 5+ (CORS, API response, dropdown display, selection, final UX)

## 12. Technical Concepts Explained

### What is SEO?
Search Engine Optimization - making your website easier for Google to understand and rank higher in search results.

### What is JSON-LD Schema?
A way to tell Google exactly what your page contains (like a nutrition label for websites). Helps Google show rich snippets in search results.

### What is Code Splitting?
Breaking your website into smaller chunks that load separately. Makes the initial page load faster.

### What is Image Optimization?
Compressing images to smaller file sizes without losing quality. Faster loading = better SEO + better user experience.

### What is a Canonical URL?
Tells Google which version of a page is the "official" one (prevents duplicate content issues).

### What is Open Graph?
Meta tags that control how your website looks when shared on social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).

   - Green badges with checkmark icons
   - Examples:
     - ✓ Wheelchair accessible
     - ✓ Women's prayer area
     - ✓ Operational
   - Data fetched from Google Places API

3. **Google Ratings:**
   - Star icon + rating number
   - "Verified on Google" label below
   - Only shown for mosques with verified data (5 mosques currently)

### Package Updates

**New Dependencies:**
- `dotenv` (for reading .env.local in Node.js script)

**New npm Script:**
```json
"fetch-mosque-data": "node scripts/fetch-mosque-data.js"
```

### Data Structure Example

```json
{
  "name": "Penshurst Mosque",
  "address": "447 Forest Rd, Penshurst NSW 2222",
  "phone": "(02) 9580 3390",
  "website": "https://penshurstmosque.com/",
  "region": "South Sydney",
  "rating": 4.9,
  "verified": true,
  "openingHours": [
    "Monday: Open 24 hours",
    "Tuesday: Open 24 hours",
    ...
  ],
  "currentlyOpen": true,
  "categories": ["place_of_worship", "mosque", "point_of_interest"],
  "attributes": ["Wheelchair accessible", "Women's prayer area", "Operational"]
}
```

### Security Implementation

**Protection Measures:**
1. `.env.local` in `.gitignore` (never committed)
2. API key only used server-side (manual script execution)
3. No client-side API calls
4. Setup guide includes API restriction instructions
5. IP whitelisting recommended in Google Cloud Console

**Verification:**
- Tested that `.env.local` not tracked by git
- Confirmed API key never appears in source code
- Validated script works with sample data

## 26. Australian Suburb Autocomplete Feature (Session 4, 2025-10-06)

### Objective
Enhance postcode input with Australian suburb autocomplete and validation to improve user experience when searching for mosques.

### Implementation Details

**File:** `src/components/MosqueLocator.tsx`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Button Text Update:**
   - From: "Enter Postcode"
   - To: "Enter Postcode or Suburb"

2. **Placeholder Text Update:**
   - From: "Enter postcode (e.g., 4103)"
   - To: "Enter any postcode or suburb"

3. **New TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
interface SuburbSuggestion {
  description: string;
  place_id: string;
}
```

4. **New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [suburbSuggestions, setSuburbSuggestions] = useState<SuburbSuggestion[]>([]);
const [showSuggestions, setShowSuggestions] = useState(false);
const [isValidLocation, setIsValidLocation] = useState(true);
```

5. **Enhanced `handlePostcodeChange` Function:**
   - Calls Google Places Autocomplete API when user types 2+ characters
   - Filters results for Australian suburbs only
   - Updates suggestions state with matching results
   - Shows dropdown if predictions found
   - Resets validation state on input change

6. **New `handleSuburbSelect` Function:**
   - Handles selection from dropdown
   - Updates input with selected suburb
   - Calls geocoding API to get place details
   - Closes dropdown and clears suggestions
   - Updates display with suburb name

7. **Dropdown UI:**
```typescript
{showSuggestions && suburbSuggestions.length > 0 && (
  <div className="absolute z-50 w-full mt-1 bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-h-60 overflow-y-auto">
    {suburbSuggestions.map((suggestion) => (
      <button
        key={suggestion.place_id}
        onClick={() => handleSuburbSelect(suggestion)}
        className="w-full text-left px-4 py-3 hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150 text-sm text-gray-700 border-b border-gray-100 last:border-b-0"
      >
        {suggestion.description}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

8. **Validation Highlighting:**
```typescript
className={`h-11 text-sm rounded-lg border focus:ring-1 ${
  !isValidLocation
    ? 'border-red-500 focus:border-red-500 focus:ring-red-500'
    : 'border-gray-300 focus:border-teal-600 focus:ring-teal-600'
}`}
```

#### Features:

✅ **Real-time Autocomplete:**
- Shows suggestions after 2+ characters
- Filters for Australian locations only
- Dropdown appears below input field
- Scrollable list for multiple results

✅ **Validation:**
- Red border when location is invalid
- Green/teal border for valid input
- Visual feedback improves UX

✅ **Smart Filtering:**
- Only shows dropdown if matching suburbs found
- No dropdown for invalid/non-matching input
- Automatically hides after selection

✅ **API Integration:**
- Uses Supabase Edge Functions:
  - `autocomplete-suburb`: Gets suburb suggestions
  - `geocode-place`: Gets place details from place_id
- Secure implementation (API key in backend)

#### User Flow:

1. User clicks "Enter Postcode or Suburb" button
2. Input field appears with placeholder text
3. User starts typing (e.g., "Melb")
4. After 2 characters, dropdown shows:
   - Melbourne VIC, Australia
   - Melba ACT, Australia
   - Melbourne Airport VIC, Australia
5. User clicks desired suburb
6. Input fills with selected suburb
7. Dropdown closes
8. Mosque search proceeds with selected location

#### Error Handling:

- Try-catch blocks for API calls
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if API fails
